This was a project for my CS281 Networks and Cryptography class,
taken second semester of my freshamn year (Spring 2013).

The poject contains several classes written by my professor, Scott Kaplan,
and modified by me. The CRCDataLinkLayer and HammingDataLinkLayer classes
were writen by me, based off of simpler Data Link Layers written by
Professor Kaplan.
